# Kongfig for Ambassador

Like the ambassador himself, who hands out Forrero Rochers to all his distinguished guests, ambassador api hands out
whatever the api equivilent of hazelnut filled chocolate balls are to Openshift.

Unfortunately there isn't an easy way to update the annotations without manually editing. `Kongfig-for-ambassador` is an
attempt to resolve this by offering kongfig style functionality to ambassador.
